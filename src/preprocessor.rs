//! This module defines the `Preprocessor` trait, which allows for generalized data to be created
//! about `BinaryObject`s prior to being run through the `ScanModule`s to avoid duplicate
//! processing. For more information on how to contribute your own preprocessor, see
//! `docs/contributing/PREPROCESSORS.md`.

/// of `String`s mapped to other `String`s that can then be accessed by the scan modules.
/// For more information on how to contribute your own preprocessor, see
