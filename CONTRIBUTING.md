# Contributing
Before contributing, be sure to familiarize yourself with the project objective, as defined in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Syntax
For Rust syntax, please follow [these](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) guidelines.

## Pull requests
Pull requests should be ready to be merged 'as-is'. If your pull request doesn't, perhaps it's a bit too early to be submitting a pull request.

## Ideology
Be sure to follow the stateless development ideology when contributing code to ArmorLib. Stateless development is described in [docs/IDEOLOGY.md](docs/IDEOLOGY.md).

## Next Steps
Several resources are offered to prospective contributors to aide the development process.
